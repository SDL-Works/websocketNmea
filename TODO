Limitations as of january 2017:
 The Sumlog settings in the configuration page are not yet implemented.
 The UDP protocols are not yet fully validated against the multiplexer.
 There are some sequence issues with AIS message 5 that has to be investigated further.
 As a temporary measure a patch is applied to aisparser/c/src/vdm_parse.c and a special handling implemented in wsocknmea.c
